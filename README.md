# SortsPrepSelection
 This is a simple program to test the efficiency through comparisons and exchanges of three basic sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, Insertion sort and 
 Selection sort. Each algorithm uses comparison and exchange counters to keep track of how often they occur in each algorithm. It then prints out the
 sorted array of using each algorithm and their respected comparuons and exchanges.
